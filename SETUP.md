### Add Repository Secrets

1. Go to your GitHub repository

3. Add these secrets:

#### GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY

- Base64 encode your service account JSON file:

  ```bash
  # On macOS/Linux:
  base64 -i config/service-account.json

  # On Windows PowerShell:
  [Convert]::ToBase64String([IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("config/service-account.json"))
  ```

- Copy the output and paste it as the secret value

#### SHEETS_CONFIG

- Copy the contents of your `config/sheets.json` file
- Paste it as the secret value (it should be valid JSON)

### Enable GitHub Actions

The workflow is already configured to run daily at midnight UTC. It will also run on manual trigger.

## 5. Google Sheets Format

Your Google Sheets should have:

- **Current Supplies** (e.g., in cell B2): A number representing current stock
- **Daily Consumption** (e.g., in cell B3): A number representing daily usage rate

Example:

```
A1: Current Supplies    B1:
A2: Stock Level         B2: 150
A3: Daily Usage         B3: 5
```

The monitor will calculate: 150 √∑ 5 = 30 days remaining

## 6. Discord Notifications

The bot will send:

- ‚úÖ **Green**: 15+ days remaining
- ‚ö° **Yellow**: 8-14 days remaining
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Orange**: 4-7 days remaining
- üö® **Red**: 1-3 days remaining

Critical and warning alerts include @everyone mentions.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"No data found in cell"**

   - Check that the cell address is correct (e.g., "B2", not "b2")
   - Ensure the cell contains a number
   - Verify the service account has access to the sheet

2. **"Authentication failed"**

   - Check that the service account JSON is valid
   - Ensure the Google Sheets API is enabled
   - Verify the service account email is shared with the sheet

3. **"Discord webhook failed"**
   - Verify the webhook URL is correct
   - Check that the webhook hasn't been deleted
   - Ensure the Discord channel still exists

### Testing Tips

- Start with one sheet configuration to test
- Use `LOG_LEVEL=debug` for more detailed logs
- Test webhooks with a simple message first
- Verify sheet permissions with a manual API call
