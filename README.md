# Supply Status Monitor

A GitHub Actions cron job that monitors Google Sheets for supply levels and sends notifications to Discord webhooks.

## Features

- Monitors multiple Google Sheets with identical formats
- **Automatically subtracts daily consumption from current supplies and updates the sheet**
- Calculates remaining supply days based on updated stock and daily consumption
- Sends formatted notifications to Discord webhooks
- Runs daily via GitHub Actions
- Uses Google Service Account for secure sheet access

## Setup

1. **Google Service Account Setup**

   - Create a Google Cloud Project
   - Enable Google Sheets API
   - Create a Service Account and download the JSON key
   - Share your Google Sheets with the service account email (with **Editor** permissions)

2. **Discord Webhook Setup**

   - Create webhooks in your Discord channels
   - Copy the webhook URLs

3. **Environment Variables**
   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your values:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. **Configuration**
   Edit `config/sheets.json` to add your sheet and webhook pairs.

5. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Configuration

### sheets.json Format

```json
[
  {
    "name": "Office Supplies",
    "sheetId": "your-google-sheet-id",
    "webhookUrl": "your-discord-webhook-url",
    "currentSuppliesCell": "B2",
    "dailyConsumptionCell": "B3"
  }
]
```

### Cell Format

- **Current Supplies Cell**: Should contain a number representing current stock (will be automatically updated)
- **Daily Consumption Cell**: Should contain a number representing daily usage rate

**Note**: Each time the script runs, it will automatically subtract the daily consumption value from the current supplies and update the Google Sheet with the new value. This ensures your supply tracking stays current without manual intervention.

## Usage

Run locally:

```bash
npm start
```

The GitHub Action will run automatically once per day at UTC midnight.

## Environment Variables

- `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY`: Base64 encoded service account JSON key
- `SHEETS_CONFIG`: JSON string of sheet configurations (for GitHub Actions)

## GitHub Actions

The workflow file (`.github/workflows/supply-monitor.yml`) is configured to:

- Run daily at midnight UTC
- Use repository secrets for sensitive data
- Send notifications on failure
